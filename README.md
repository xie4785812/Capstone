<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In recent years, the science of combining machine learning algorithms and finance has become popular in the financial industry around the world, especially in the stock market. The prediction of stock prices through various models can more easily and steadily create revenue. This paper will mainly combine machine learning algorithms and databases to build a stock system with forecasting capabilities. We explore the relationship between stock prices, gold prices and exchange rates.

### Built With
For the data / analysis library used in this project, you can refer to the following link
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Data

The real-time stock data we used are all captured from Yahoo Finance, which includes data of five stocks, including the time interval for Apple, Tesla, NVIDA, FaceBook, and Microsoft to start crawling on June 9, 2020. Real-time stock data for 5 seconds. The data file provided is Json, under the file of data.



* [NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history?p=NVDA)
* [Apple Inc.(AAPL)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&.tsrc=fin-srch)
* [Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch)
* [Facebook, Inc. (FB)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB?p=FB&.tsrc=fin-srch)
* [Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA&.tsrc=fin-srch)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## How to use


First download all the data files from data, which contains the five kinds of stock data required by our model.

Open the MongoDB, click on create database, the database name must be: StockAnalyze, the collection name can input anything but not empty:

<p align="center">
<img src="work/create_database.png" alt="Logo">
</p>

After Successfully create the database, next to create collection, there are five collections you need to create: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, FB, TSLA:

<p align="center">
<img src="work/create_collection.png" alt="Logo">
</p>

Then to import the data, click on collection on the top of the interface, choose Import Data, then browse the data file that same as the stock data you want to import, click on IMPORT.

<p align="center">
<img src="work/import_data.png" alt="Logo">
</p>

Then you can use this database.

<img src="work/op3.png" alt="Logo">
</p>


Then open the location of the file through the terminal and enter python model_run.py run, you can test all models of each stock data.

    (base) ..\PycharmProject\capstone\python model_run.py run

We also support the testing of a single model of a single data, enter python model_run.py data_select feature_select model_select, where data_select includes NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, FB, MSFT, feature_select includes simple and fix(regression and status box classfication), and if choose simple, it will automatically run the regression, if you choose the fix, u will next to choose one of them: svm, bpn, hmm, hmm_box to test the case you want to.

    (base) ..\PycharmProject\capstone\python model_run.py AAPL simple

This means to use the simple feature extraction and regression to run on the AAPL real-time data

    (base) ..\PycharmProject\capstone\python model_run.py AAPL fix bpn

This means to use the status box classfication and BPN to run on the AAPL real-time data

    (base) ..\PycharmProject\capstone\python model_run.py AAPL fix svm
    
This means to use the status box classfication and SVM to run on the AAPL real-time data

    (base) ..\PycharmProject\capstone\python model_run.py AAPL fix hmm_box

This means to use the status box classfication and HMM to run on the AAPL real-time data

    (base) ..\PycharmProject\capstone\python model_run.py AAPL fix hmm

This means to use the status box classfication and HMM to run on the AAPL historical data

If something you type in wrong, it will exit the system, you need to re-enter the sentence

## Discussion
So far, the prediction results of the last minute before the closing of the five stocks are in the Png document. You can click to view the prediction results of different models corresponding to different stocks.
