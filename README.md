<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In recent years, the science of combining machine learning algorithms and finance has become popular in the financial industry around the world, especially in the stock market. The prediction of stock prices through various models can more easily and steadily create revenue. This paper will mainly combine machine learning algorithms and databases to build a stock system with forecasting capabilities. We explore the relationship between stock prices, gold prices and exchange rates.

### Built With
For the data / analysis library used in this project, you can refer to the following link
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
